# Slavic Intent Classification

Repository for implementation of NLP group project "Intent Classification for Slavic Languages" by group GPT Ghostwriters.

> Intent classification is a relevant area of research in machine learning, with applications in domains such as marketing, product design and dialogue systems. This paper presents a method for intent classification of utterances in Slavic languages. It leverages pre-trained language models such as HerBERT, XLM and mT5 as foundational frameworks. The approach involves fine-tuning these backbones along with classification heads and then training them on either language-specific or combined utterances in Polish, Slovak and Russian available in MASSIVE dataset.
